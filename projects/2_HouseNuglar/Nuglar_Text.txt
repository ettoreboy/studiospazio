House Atelier, Nuglar, Switzerland
direct commission, 2015-

The church is based on a square floor plan and stands on a small artificial hill. We placed four spaces towards each direction in order to establish a relation with the surrounding environment; the portico faces the city, the chapel faces the garden, the utility space faces the access street and the youth room faces the park. The lateral spaces are arranged in a spiral form and establish a church without any strong direction. Furthermore, the lateral spaces and the central space are separated by inclined walls, which establish a complementary relation between them. Without being directly connected to the exterior, the existence of the exterior environment can be sensed from the interior space of the church. The central space posses both the “limited“ and “expanding” space by the means of the lower straight walls and the higher inclined walls above the chest; during the celebration, we can experience the transition of these two spaces while sitting and standing.
